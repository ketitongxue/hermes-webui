# ☤ Hermes HUD — Web UI

A browser-based consciousness monitor for [Hermes](https://github.com/nousresearch/hermes-agent), the AI agent with persistent memory.

Same data, same soul, same dashboard that made the [TUI version](https://github.com/joeynyc/hermes-hud) popular — now in your browser.

## What It Shows

Everything your agent knows about itself, across 13 tabs:

| Tab | What You See |
|-----|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | Identity, conversation stats, memory bars, service health, recent skills, active projects, cron jobs, tool usage, daily sparkline |
| **Memory** | Agent memory + user profile capacity bars, entries by category |
| **Skills** | Category breakdown, skill details with source paths, custom skill badges |
| **Sessions** | Session history with message/token counts, source breakdown, daily sparklines |
| **Cron** | Scheduled jobs with schedule, last/next run, delivery target, prompt preview |
| **Projects** | Repos grouped by activity (active/recent/stale), branch, dirty files, languages |
| **Health** | API key status, service health with PIDs, provider/model info |
| **Agents** | Live/idle processes, operator alert queue, recent session history |
| **Chat** | Live chat with the agent — SSE streaming, multiple sessions, tool call visibility, reasoning display |
| **Profiles** | Full profile cards — model, provider, gateway status, soul summary, toolsets |
| **Costs** | Per-model USD cost estimates, daily trend, input/output/cache breakdown |
| **Corrections** | Corrections grouped by severity (critical/major/minor) with timestamps |
| **Patterns** | Task clusters, hourly activity heatmap, repeated prompts flagged as skill candidates |

## Real-Time Updates

The HUD updates instantly when your agent's data changes. No manual refresh needed.

- **WebSocket** — Live connection broadcasts changes as they happen
- **Smart Caching** — Backend caches expensive operations (sessions, skills, patterns) with automatic invalidation when files change
- **Silent Updates** — Data refreshes in the background without loading flashes or UI blinking
- **Live Indicator** — "● live" badge in the status bar shows when real-time connection is active

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joeynyc/hermes-hudui.git
cd hermes-hudui
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
./install.sh
hermes-hudui
```

Open http://localhost:3001

On future runs, just activate and start:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
hermes-hudui
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ (for building the frontend)
- A running Hermes agent with data in `~/.hermes/`

No other packages required — the Web UI reads directly from your agent's data directory.

## Manual Install

```bash
# 1. Create and activate virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install this package
pip install -e .

# 3. Build the frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cp -r dist/* ../backend/static/

# 4. Start the server
hermes-hudui
```

## Themes

Four color themes, switchable with `t` key or the theme picker:

| Theme | Key | Mood |
|-------|-----|------|
| **Neural Awakening** | `ai` | Cyan/blue on deep navy. Clean, clinical intelligence. |
| **Blade Runner** | `blade-runner` | Amber/orange on warm black. Neo-noir dystopia. |
| **fsociety** | `fsociety` | Green on pure black. Raw hacker aesthetic. |
| **Anime** | `anime` | Purple/violet on indigo. Psychic energy. |

Optional CRT scanline overlay — toggle via theme picker.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1`–`9`, `0` | Switch tabs (Dashboard through Profiles) |
| `t` | Toggle theme picker |
| `Ctrl+K` | Command palette |

Corrections and Patterns tabs are click-only (no hotkey — more than 10 tabs).

## Architecture

```
React Frontend (Vite + SWR)
    ↓ /api/* (proxied in dev) + WebSocket /ws
FastAPI Backend (Python)
    ↓ collectors/*.py + cache + file watcher
~/.hermes/ (agent data files)
```

**Backend:**
- **Collectors** — Read from `~/.hermes/` and return dataclasses
- **Caching** — Intelligent cache with mtime-based invalidation (sessions: 30s, skills: 60s, patterns: 60s, profiles: 45s TTL)
- **File Watcher** — Watches `~/.hermes/` for changes using `watchfiles`
- **WebSocket** — Broadcasts `data_changed` events to all connected clients

**Frontend:**
- **SWR** — Fetches from `/api/*` with `keepPreviousData` for silent background updates
- **WebSocket Hook** — Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff, triggers SWR revalidation on change events
- **Panels** — One component per tab, shows stale data during refresh (no loading flashes)
- **Chat** — SSE streaming via `EventSource`, per-session message cache in `useChat.ts`, fixed-height layout with internal scroll

**Chat Engine (`backend/chat/engine.py`):**
- Singleton that spawns `hermes chat -q <message> -Q --source tool` per message
- Streams stdout line-by-line, filters TUI box-drawing decoration via regex
- Sessions are isolated client-side — no server-side message persistence

## Token Cost Pricing

Costs are calculated from token counts using hardcoded per-model pricing. Supported models:

| Provider | Model | Input | Output | Cache Read |
|----------|-------|------:|-------:|-----------:|
| Anthropic | Claude Opus 4 | $15/M | $75/M | $1.50/M |
| Anthropic | Claude Sonnet 4 | $3/M | $15/M | $0.30/M |
| Anthropic | Claude Haiku 3.5 | $0.80/M | $4/M | $0.08/M |
| OpenAI | GPT-4o | $2.50/M | $10/M | $1.25/M |
| OpenAI | o1 | $15/M | $60/M | $7.50/M |
| DeepSeek | V3 | $0.27/M | $1.10/M | $0.07/M |
| xAI | Grok 3 | $3/M | $15/M | $0.75/M |
| Google | Gemini 2.5 Pro | $1.25/M | $10/M | $0.31/M |

Models not in the table fall back to Claude Opus pricing. Local/free models are detected and priced at $0.

## Relationship to the TUI

This is the browser companion to [hermes-hud](https://github.com/joeynyc/hermes-hud). Both read from the same `~/.hermes/` data directory independently. You can use either one, or both at the same time.

The Web UI is fully standalone — it ships its own data collectors and doesn't require the TUI package. It adds features the TUI doesn't have: dedicated Memory, Skills, and Sessions tabs; per-model token cost tracking; command palette; theme switcher with live preview.

If you also have the TUI installed (`pip install hermes-hud`), you can enable it with `pip install hermes-hudui[tui]`.

## Platform Support

- **macOS** — native, install via `./install.sh`
- **Linux** — native, install via `./install.sh`
- **Windows** — via WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- **WSL** — install script detects WSL automatically
